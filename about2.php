Between 2012 and 2017, over a million students around the world learned Python 2
from this content on the web and on the Coursera platform.  As of January 1, 2020
Python 2 is
<a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/" target="_new">no longer supported</a>
and so this site has been archived.<br/>

PythonLearn is intended to collect a set of generic Python Learning Resources
to allow self-paced learning of the Python Language. 
The materials from the site were collected from several courses at
the University of Michigan that used Python:
<ul>
<li> 
EECS/SI 182 - Building Applications for Information Environments
<li>
SI 502 - Networked Computing: Storage, Communication, and Processing
<li>
SI 539 - Design of Complex Web Sites
</p>
</ul>
